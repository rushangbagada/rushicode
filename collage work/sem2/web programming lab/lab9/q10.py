# . A movie theater 
# charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 3, 
# the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, 
# the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of 
# their movie ticket
