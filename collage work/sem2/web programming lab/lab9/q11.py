#  Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album. 
# The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a 
# dictionary containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three 
# dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that the 
# dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.  
# Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks 
# on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to 
# the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of 
# tracks on an album.
